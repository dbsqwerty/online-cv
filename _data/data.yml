      the handle dbsqwerty or dbsqwerty123 or a_lazy_cat. I am currently in the Integrated \n\
      Programme in Anglo Chinese School Independent in Singapore. CTFs are my \n\

      and cryptography too! Additionally, I am also the programmer for ACSI \n\
      Robotics Team 8059 Blank and won several robotics competitions. In my spare  \n\
      time, I usually CAD or 3D print or head out to practice my photography.       \n"
