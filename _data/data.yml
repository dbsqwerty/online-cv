  summary: "I am Sean Seah, a nearly 16-year-old kid (getting there) usually going by   \n\
      the handle dbsqwerty or dbsqwerty123 or a_lazy_cat. I am currently in the Integrated \n\
      Programme in Anglo Chinese School Independent in Singapore. CTFs are my \n\
      biggest passion, and I usually play in teams HATS Singapore as well as \n\
      OpenToAll or with my fellow schoolmates and seniors. I mostly work with \n\

      and cryptography too! Additionally, I am also the programmer for ACSI \n\
      Robotics Team 8059 Blank and won several robotics competitions. In my spare  \n\
      time, I usually CAD or 3D print or head out to practice my photography.       \n"
