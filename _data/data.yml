  summary: "I am Sean Seah, a nearly 16-year-old kid (getting there) usually going by the handle dbsqwerty or\n\
      dbsqwerty123 or a_lazy_cat. I am currently in the Integrated Programme in Anglo Chinese School\n\
      Independent in Singapore. CTFs are my biggest passion, and I usually play with HATS Singapore as well\n\
      as OpenToAll or with my friends. I am mostly interested in forensics, but I am actively learning about\n\
      binary exploitation and cryptography too! I am also the programmer for ACSI Robotics Team 8059\n\
      Blank and won several robotics competitions. In my spare time, I enjoy doing CAD, 3D-Printing and\n\ 
      photography.\n"
